I am a mathematician and engineer passionate about making complex topics accessible to a broad audience. 
I have worked in numerical analysis, data science, numerical simulation, parallel computing, and machine 
learning, researching and teaching in academia and industry. My passion comes from my journey from not 
knowing what a mathematician does to becoming a Ph.D. in computational and mathematical engineering, 
as well as working in highly technical environments where fundamental challenges have been solved with 
clear communication between all the stakeholders. Here is my journey:

**(2021 - ) ML solutions engineer at [Cerebras Systems](https://www.cerebras.net)**

Cerebras is an AI-specialized Hardware and Software startup revolutionizing the Deep Learning
landscape by simplifying the training of large language models with unique solutions ([here](https://medium.com/authority-magazine/the-future-is-now-cindy-orozco-bohorquez-of-cerebras-systems-on-how-their-technological-innovation-680cac8903ef) is more about my story). At Cerebras, I:

* Mentor and manage the ml solutions team. This team has grown from two to five members and supports more than 15 active
  enterprise customers in energy, pharmaceutics, financial services, and national laboratories, among others,

* Design and implementation of joint research projects in NLP (Transformers, BERT, GPT); some examples are:

   * [GenSLMs: Genome-scale language models reveal SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary dynamics](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.10.511571v2)
     in collaboration with [Argonne National Labs](https://www.alcf.anl.gov/).
     This work received the [Special Gordon Bell Prize 2022 at SC22](https://www.cerebras.net/blog/genomics-in-unparalleled-resolution-cerebras-wafer-scale-cluster-trains-large-language-models-on-the-full-covid-genome-sequence).

   * [Accelerating NLP Model Training and Enabling Higher Accuracy for Financial Services Applications](https://f.hubspotusercontent30.net/hubfs/8968533/Cerebras-Financial-Institution-NLP-case-study.pdf).

* Work with multiple stakeholders on engineering, customer, and executives, driving customer feedback and quickly adapting to a changing environment,
 
* Develop user journey, [introductory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgQ1aJ1DmlA) and [advanced](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FV6LBBFb4g) training materials, [multiple-day workshops](https://events.cels.anl.gov/event/333/), 
  and reformat documentation to include new product offerings and user-centric perspective.
